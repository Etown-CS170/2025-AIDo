      "user": "We're planning a wedding for next summer and have a budget of $25,000. Is that realistic?",
      "assistant": "A $25,000 budget for a summer wedding is definitely workable! The national average for weddings is around $30,000, so you're right in a realistic range.<br><br>Here's a rough breakdown:<br>• <strong>Venue and catering</strong> typically take 40-50% of your budget ($10,000-12,500)<br>• <strong>Photography</strong> 10-15% ($2,500-3,750)<br>• <strong>Flowers and decor</strong> 8-10% ($2,000-2,500)<br>• <strong>Attire</strong> about 8-10% ($2,000-2,500)<br><br>The remaining can cover music, invitations, and other details. Summer is peak wedding season, so booking early will help you secure better deals. Would you like help prioritizing which areas are most important to you?"

      "user": "How far in advance should we send save-the-dates?",
      "assistant": "Save-the-dates should ideally be sent <strong>6-8 months</strong> before your wedding date. If you're planning a destination wedding or getting married during a holiday weekend, send them even earlier - around <strong>9-12 months</strong> in advance.<br><br>This gives your guests plenty of time to request time off work, make travel arrangements, and keep your date clear. Just make sure you've finalized your venue and date before sending them out! Formal invitations typically follow 6-8 weeks before the wedding."

      "user": "What are some good outdoor venue ideas?",
      "assistant": "Outdoor venues offer so many beautiful options! Here are some popular choices:<br><br><strong>Gardens and botanical gardens</strong> provide natural beauty with blooming flowers and manicured landscapes.<br><br><strong>Vineyards and wineries</strong> offer stunning views with rolling hills and grapevines.<br><br><strong>Beaches</strong> create a romantic, relaxed atmosphere perfect for sunset ceremonies.<br><br><strong>Barns and farms</strong> give you a rustic, countryside charm.<br><br><strong>Parks and estates</strong> can offer versatility with both formal and casual settings.<br><br>When choosing an outdoor venue, always have a backup plan for weather - look for venues with covered areas or tent options. Also consider guest comfort with shade, fans or heaters depending on the season, and accessible restrooms."

      "user": "I'm feeling overwhelmed with all the planning. Where should I even start?",
      "assistant": "It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed - wedding planning involves so many moving parts! Let's break it down into manageable steps.<br><br><strong>Start with the big three:</strong> date, budget, and guest count.<br><br>Once you have those figured out, book your <strong>venue</strong> since that often dictates everything else.<br><br>Next, secure your key vendors: <strong>photographer, caterer, and officiant</strong>. These book up quickly, especially for popular dates.<br><br>After that, you can tackle dress shopping, invitations, and decor at a more relaxed pace.<br><br>Remember, you don't have to do everything at once! Focus on one task at a time, and consider creating a timeline or checklist to track your progress. What feels most urgent to you right now?"

      "user": "Should we hire a wedding planner?",
      "assistant": "Whether to hire a wedding planner depends on your budget, time, and comfort level with organizing.<br><br><strong>Full-service planner:</strong> Great if you're very busy, planning from a distance, or want professional guidance throughout the entire process. They typically cost 10-20% of your budget but can save you money through vendor connections and help you avoid costly mistakes.<br><br><strong>Day-of coordinator:</strong> A more budget-friendly option at $800-2,000 and handles logistics on your wedding day so you can relax.<br><br><strong>DIY:</strong> If you enjoy planning and have the time, you can certainly handle it yourself with help from family and friends.<br><br>Consider your stress tolerance and whether the peace of mind is worth the investment. Many couples find that at least a day-of coordinator is invaluable."

      "user": "What questions should we ask when touring venues?",
      "assistant": "Great thinking ahead! Here are essential questions to ask:<br><br>• What's included in the rental fee and what costs extra?<br>• Is there an in-house catering requirement or can you bring your own?<br>• What's the capacity for both ceremony and reception?<br>• Are tables, chairs, and linens provided?<br>• What's the backup plan for weather if it's outdoors?<br>• When do you need to provide a final guest count?<br>• Are there any restrictions on music, decorations, or timing?<br>• What time can vendors access the space for setup?<br>• Is there parking available for guests?<br>• Can you see the space set up for a wedding?<br><br>Also ask about their cancellation policy and whether they have insurance requirements. Take notes and photos during each tour so you can compare venues later!"
